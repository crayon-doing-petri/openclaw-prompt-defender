# openclaw-prompt-defender

Built with: Kimi K2.5 (via Ollama Cloud) • OpenClaw v2026.2.4

**Prompt injection detection and jailbreak prevention** for OpenClaw — combining the best of `prompt-guard` and `detect-injection` using the **Plugin Gateway Pattern**.

**Current Status:** ✅ Input filtering ready (via `message:received` hook) — Output filtering pending upstream OpenClaw contribution.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for full architecture, design decisions, and implementation strategy.

---

## Overview

This project implements a security filter for OpenClaw that scans **user input** for prompt injection and jailbreak attempts before they reach the LLM model.

**Short-term:** Input protection only (works immediately)  
**Long-term:** Full bidirectional filtering via upstream OpenClaw contribution (see [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md))

| Source | Strength | Ported |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **prompt-guard** | Fast pattern matching, 70% token reduction, SHIELD categories, owner bypass | ✅ |
| **detect-injection** | Dual-layer scanning, HF-based vector detection, safety categories | ✅ |

---

## Architecture

Two-layer security filtering via **Plugin Gateway Pattern**:

- **Plugin** (TypeScript, sandboxed) — hooks into OpenClaw, delegates to service via HTTP
- **Service** (Python/FastAPI, host) — runs prompt-guard, detect-injection, 1Password CLI

**Current:** User input flows through `message:received` hook → `/scan` endpoint → Security Service → Block/Allow  
**Future:** Tool output filtering via `before_tool_result` hook (upstream contribution in progress)

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for:
- Full architecture diagram
- The hook timing gap that requires upstream contribution
- Our plan to contribute `before_tool_result` hook to OpenClaw

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install service dependencies
cd ~/Projects/openclaw-prompt-defender/service
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start the service (Terminal 1)
python app.py
# → Service running on http://127.0.0.1:8080

# 3. Build and install plugin (Terminal 2)
cd ~/Projects/openclaw-prompt-defender/plugin
npm install && npm run build

# 4. Configure OpenClaw (see example below)
# Add plugin config to ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json

# 5. Restart OpenClaw
openclaw gateway restart
```

## OpenClaw Configuration

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "load": {
      "prompt-defender": {
        "package": "~/Projects/openclaw-prompt-defender/plugin",
        "config": {
          "service_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080",
          "timeout_ms": 5000,
          "fail_open": true,
          "owner_ids": ["1461460866850357345"],
          "scan_input": true,
          "scan_output": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** `scan_output` is currently disabled (`false`) because the `tool_result_persist` hook fires **after** the LLM has already seen the content. Output filtering will be enabled after we contribute the `before_tool_result` hook upstream.

## Filter Profiles

| Profile | Type | Checks | Action | Status |
|---------|------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Input (strict)** | `input` | Injection, jailbreak, obfuscation, SHIELD categories | Block or allow | ✅ **Ready** |
| **Output (moderate)** | `output` | PII scrub, content safety, size limit | Sanitize or allow | ⏳ **Pending upstream** |

---

## Error Handling — Fail Open

By default, the plugin uses **fail-open** strategy: if the security service is unreachable, times out, or errors, the plugin allows and logs a warning. This prevents the security filter outage from blocking all agent functionality.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for detailed implementation phases and the hook timing gap that necessitates this approach.

## Why Input First?

The `message:received` hook fires **before** the LLM processes user messages, allowing us to block injection attempts immediately. This is fully functional and provides immediate value.

Output filtering via `tool_result_persist` has a **timing gap** — it fires after the LLM has already seen the tool output. We're solving this by contributing a new `before_tool_result` hook to OpenClaw.

See [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) for the technical analysis.

## Related Projects

| Project | Focus | Complementary? |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| [Knostic Shield](https://github.com/knostic/openclaw-shield) | Secrets, PII, destructive commands | ✅ Yes — use both |
| Our Prompt Defender | Prompt injection, jailbreak | ✅ Different threats |

**Recommendation:** Use Knostic Shield for data protection + Our Prompt Defender for input validation.
